# Project Name: Ciy Explorer

**Author**: Ammar Badwan
**Version**: 3.0.0

## Overview

We are building this application to show information from API's about cities.

## Getting Started

You need to know how to use NodeJS, express, SQL and PostgresSQL.

## Architecture

We will get the JSON data from API's and show the result on a front-end webpage using server libraries and javascript/nodeJS.

Then save the result into a database.
